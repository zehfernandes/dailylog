#### `Futura is an idea`

- Futura origin created by Paul Renner in 1927
- Paul Renner's Futura Typeface is just one execution of a large idea that appears in hundred other fonts. 
- Geometric fonts born in the same period of Futura: [Erbar]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erbar_(typeface)
), [Kabel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabel_(typeface))
- In 1930 the preeminent French foundry, Deberny & Peignot, licensed a copy of Futura and released it under the name Europe.
- Futura "redesign" from Bauer, completing the hegemony of idea, over the true product.
- Frutiger created a customized version of Futura: Alpha BP. In his words "It is an attempt to create a more geometrical Futura."
    > Many of the subtle optical corrections Renner made for Futura, such as the tapered bowl or curved joints to open the counters, and differences in stroke widths. Renner's optical edits improved Futura's legibility at small sizes but made the typeface less systematic.


#### `apropriation of ideas`

- Build your brand big enough with Futura, and you can even sell your egalitarian, anticorporate utopia on the free market. 
	> Supreme uses a logo that steals Kruger's subversive design.
- The broad similarity in politics campaign design, especially on social media, may have contributed to the inability of each of the candidates to convince Americans of the uniqueness of his or her messages, and demonstrates that campaign design follows trends more often than it sets them. Perhaps each candidate wanted to fit in rather than stand out.
- [Wes Anderson is a big fan](https://www.marksimonson.com/notebook/view/RoyalTenenbaumsWorldofFutura) of Futura


### Historical Notion
